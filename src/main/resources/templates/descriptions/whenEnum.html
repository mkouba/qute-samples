The <code>\{#when}</code> section matches a tested value against all blocks sequentially until a condition is satisfied. The first matching block is executed and all other blocks are ignored. A tested value that resolves to an enum is handled and validated specifically. The parameters of <code>\{#is}</code>/<code>\{#case}</code> blocks are not evaluated as expressions but compared with the result of <code>toString()</code> invocation upon the tested value. Moreover, an enum constant is validated if the tested value has a type information available and resolves to an enum type..
