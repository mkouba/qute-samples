The <code>\{#when}</code> section is similar to Java’s <code>switch</code> or Kotlin’s <code>when</code> constructs. 
It matches a tested value against all blocks sequentially until a condition is satisfied. 
The first matching block is executed. All other blocks are ignored (this behavior differs to the Java <code>switch</code> where a break statement is necessary).
