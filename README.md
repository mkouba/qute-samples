# Qute Samples

This repository contains a simple [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) application that shows the key features of the [Qute templating engine](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference) in action.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the application in the dev mode: `mvn quarkus:dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in the browser
4. Start playing ;-)

## Snippets

Each sample lists the source files of the snippets used in the sample. For example the "Hello Elvis" sample uses one snippet: `src/main/resources/templates/snippets/hello.html`. You can modify the snippet file and reload the page to see the results immediately.
